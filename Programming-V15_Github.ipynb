    "# Option Pricing using different techniques\n",
    "## Comparative study using Binomial Tree and Geometric Brownian Motion\n",
    "In the financial markets, options represent a prevalent form of derivatives, offering the holder the privilege, yet not the compulsion, to purchase or dispose of an underlying asset at a predetermined price by or before a set date. Given their intricate nature and adaptability, the precise pricing of options is a focal point of ongoing study and is imperative for effective risk management, trading strategies, and investment choices.\n",
    "In this project, I developed code to price options using two distinct models: the first employing Geometric Brownian Motion and the second utilizing a Binomial Tree approach. To ensure realistic input values for volatility, I estimated this parameter using historical stock data sourced from Yahoo Finance.\n",
    "European options were priced using both methods to facilitate a comparative analysis. American, digital, and American-digital options were priced using the method best suited to their specific characteristics.\n"

    "## 1. Binomial Asset Pricing Model\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "A binomial tree with 'n' periods is a stochastic model that approximates the dynamics of a stock price as it evolves over time. Initially, the entire duration of the option is partitioned into infinitesimally small intervals (∆t). Under the no-arbitrage principle, each point in price experiences upward and downward movements. Over time, these price changes propagate exponentially, forming a binary tree illustrating the stock price's path leading up to the option's expiration. To compute option prices, the value at each previous node is estimated from the final time node's price (at time T) and calculated backward to the present moment. This iterative process yields the option prices (Meng, Y. (2022)).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S^{(n)}(i+1)= \\left\\{ \n",
    "\\begin{aligned} \n",
    "uS^{(n)}(j) &: \\text{ if prices increase from } i \\text{ to } i+1 \\\\\n",
    "dS^{(n)}(j) &: \\text{ if prices decrease from } i \\text{ to } i+1 \n",
    "\\end{aligned} \n",
    "\\right. \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a discrete-time stochastic process in which the underlying price can only go up or down. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, it is a prerequisite that the value of 'u' must be greater than 'd', with the initial stock price represented as $S{(n)}(0) = s$. According to the Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (CRR tree) model, the determination of the up and down factors is reliant on volatility. Furthermore, the time duration for each step is quantified in years. The model incorporates upward or downward movements in log prices, a feature determined by the specified parameters (Meng, Y. (2022)):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u=e^{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\delta t}}$$\n",
    "$$d=e^{-\\sigma\\sqrt{\\delta t}}=\\frac{1}{u}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$S^{(n)}(i+1)$**: $S^{(n)}$ denotes the initial stock price at time $t=0$. $S^{(n)}(i+1)$ represents the asset price at step $i+1$ in path $n$ of a tree model. This value is calculated by multiplying the current price $S^{(n)}j$ by an up factor $u$ or a down factor $d$, depending on market movements from one step to the next in the tree model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$j$**: In a tree model, $j$ is used as an index or position within a specific step $i$. It helps identify distinct states or price levels of an asset at each step in the model. This index is key in tracing the path of an asset's price and calculating its value at various points in a binomial tree model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **$u$**: In a tree model, $u$ represents the factor of proportional increase in an asset's price, calculated using the formula $e^{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\delta t}}$. This factor is crucial for simulating the potential upward movement in the asset's price over a discrete time interval, reflecting the impact of market volatility and time on price dynamics. The value of $u$ is derived from the asset's volatility $\\sigma$ and a small time step $\\delta t$, capturing the essence of price fluctuation in a specified time frame, which is vital for options pricing and risk management.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "     \n",
    "- **$d$**: In a tree model, $d$ denotes the factor for the proportional decrease in an asset's price, calculated as $d = e^{-\\sigma\\sqrt{\\delta t}}$ or equivalently as $d = \\frac{1}{u}$. This factor is key in modeling the potential downward movement of an asset's price over a discrete time interval, taking into account the asset's volatility and the effects of time. The value of $d$ is inversely related to $u$, the up factor, and is a function of the asset's volatility $\\sigma$ and a small time step $\\delta t$, thereby reflecting possible downward price fluctuations within a specific timeframe, crucial for options pricing and risk assessment.\n",

    " \n",
    "#### Option value at final node:\n",
    "Upon learning u and d, the price of the asset at each node can be calculated. Subsequently, determining the option value at the final node (the option's expiration date - time T) becomes necessary. The option value is:\n",
    "\n",
    "For call options: $MAX[(S_{n}-K),0]$\n",
    "\n",
    "For put options: $MAX[(K-S_{n}),0]$\n",
    "##### Parameters\n",
    "- **$K$**: The strike price $K$ is the price at which an option holder can exercise their right to buy or sell the underlying asset. The strike price is a key determinant of the value of an option. The closer the market price of the underlying asset is to the strike price, the more valuable the option is. Call options: The holder can buy the underlying asset at a discount if the market price is higher than the strike price. Put options: The holder can sell the underlying asset at a premium if the market price is lower than the strike price.\n",
    "       \n",
    "\n",
    "- **$S_{n}$**: $S_{n}$ is the price of the underlying asset at the $n^{th}$ period (expiration date) and, it is a key element in determining the value of an option at its maturity.This price is crucial for calculating the actual gain or loss realized from the option, as it determines whether the option is \"in the money\" or \"out of the money\" at expiration.\n",

    "#### Option value at previous node:\n",
    "Now it's necessary to discount the value at time T to the previous node T-1. Following the Risk-Neutral Valuation and Replication principle, the anticipated value is computed by weighing the option values from the subsequent two nodes according to their respective probabilities, as follows:\n",

    "$$p=\\frac{e^{r\\Delta t - d}}{u-d}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "- **$S_{u}$**: The asset's price if it increases in the next time step. It's calculated by multiplying the current price with the up factor $u$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$S_{d}$**: The asset's price if it decreases in the next time step. It's calculated by multiplying the current price with the down factor $d$.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **$\\frac{e^{r\\Delta t - d}}{u-d}$**: The formula for calculating $p$, the risk-neutral probability. It balances the up and down factors $u$ and $d$ with the risk-free rate, ensuring that the expected return in the model matches the risk-free rate over the time increment $\\Delta t$.\n",

    "## 1. Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Concept\n",
    "Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) is a mathematical model used to describe the continuous-time, stochastic behaviour of stock prices. The basic idea for this model is that the prices of an option follow a drift (μ) over a certain period of time and get deviated from it after the occurrence of a shock (ϵ). The only random part of the formula lies in the Wiener process, which follows a standard normal distribution (~N(0,1)); this process describes how the price of a stock changes inadvertently with its variance and passing of time and that, if σ was equal to 0, the price of the stock would be equal to its expected value multiplied by the passing of time (Hull, J.C. (2017)).\n",

    "##### Equation\n",
    "$$ dS(t) = \\mu S(t) dt + \\sigma S(t) dW(t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It incorporates randomness (volatility) and trend (drift) to simulate how stock prices evolve over time, forming the basis for financial models like the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$S(t)$**: The stock price at time 𝑡 in the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model, which follows a stochastic process with normally distributed returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$\\mu$**: The expected return or drift rate of the stock, representing the average rate of return in a trend without randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$\\sigma$**: The volatility or standard deviation of the stock's returns, indicating the degree of uncertainty or variability in the stock price movements. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **$dW(t)$**: A small increment of a Wiener process (Brownian motion) that introduces randomness into the stock price's growth in the GBM model.\n"

    "## DIGITAL OPTION PRICING - Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)\n",
    "A digital option, also known as a binary or all-or-nothing option, is a type of financial option with a fixed payout if the underlying asset's price meets a specified condition at the option's expiration. The payout is either a fixed amount (cash-or-nothing) or nothing at all (asset-or-nothing). Digital options are called \"binary\" because there are only two possible outcomes."

    "An American digital option is a financial derivative that combines features of both American-style options and digital options. An American options provide the holder with the right to exercise the option at any time before or at the expiration date. This flexibility to exercise early is a distinguishing feature compared to European options, which can only be exercised at expiration. Regarding the digital option, we have already provided the definition and the charateristics.\n",
